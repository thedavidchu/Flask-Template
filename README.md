# Flask-Template

## Purpose
This code outlines the first major steps in creating a Flask website according to the tutorial. It is handy to have all in one place in case I need to make a lame-duck website in a pinch.

## Functionality

This code has the ability to make a blog.

Run it by typing into CMD
